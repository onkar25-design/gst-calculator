            <h2>GST - Goods and Services Tax</h2>
            <p class="text-center">GST was implemented mainly to bring about uniformity in tax collection. In the GST regime, tax is collected cumulatively at the end stage of production of goods or services. There are five slabs to collect GST that are 5%, 12%, 18% and 28%, and different goods and services fall under different tax slabs. Additionally, there are goods that do not attract any GST.</p>
